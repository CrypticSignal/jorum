# jorum

Jorum (**J**ava F**orum**) is a simple forum application written using the Spring Boot framework for the backend and React on the frontend. It is currently a work in progress and I am developing it primarily to teach myself Spring Boot and React.

## Installation

Executing `mvnw spring-boot:run` in the root folder of this project will build and run the backend for you.

## Dependencies

PostgreSQL is required for the database. See `application.properties`.
